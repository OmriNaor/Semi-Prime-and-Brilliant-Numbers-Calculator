# Semi-Prime & Brilliant Numbers Calculator

## Introduction

This project introduces a web-based calculator for determining semi-prime and brilliant numbers. It is designed to educate and provide interactive exploration into specific mathematical concepts: semi-prime numbers, which are products of two primes, and brilliant numbers, a subset of semi-primes where the prime factors have the same number of digits. The application features a simple, user-friendly interface allowing users to enter a number and instantly receive visual feedback on semi-prime and brilliant numbers up to their input.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy interaction.
- **Mathematical Concepts Exploration**: Enables exploration of semi-prime and brilliant numbers.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual feedback by highlighting semi-prime and brilliant numbers.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for non-integer and negative inputs.

## Components

The application comprises three main files:

- `MainPage.html`: The HTML document providing the structure of the web application.
- `MainPage.js`: Contains the logic for calculating semi-prime and brilliant numbers, along with dynamic HTML manipulation for displaying results.
- `MainPage.css`: Defines the styling for the web application, ensuring a visually appealing interface.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a positive integer in the input field on the web page.
2. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application evaluates all numbers up to the given input.
3. The app identifies semi-prime numbers and further checks for brilliant numbers among them.
4. Results are visually displayed, with semi-prime numbers and brilliant numbers highlighted in different colors.

## Running the Application

To use the calculator, simply open the `MainPage.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that `MainPage.js` and `MainPage.css` are located in the same directory as the HTML file for the application to function correctly.

## Testing

The application can be tested by entering various numbers and observing the output. Try inputs like prime numbers, products of two primes with equal and unequal digit counts, and larger numbers to explore the behavior of the application across different scenarios.

## Remarks

This project serves as a practical application of web development skills, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an educational tool. It demonstrates handling user input, performing calculations, and dynamically updating the web page based on the results. The project is intended for educational purposes and showcases the implementation of mathematical concepts in a web application.
